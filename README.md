# HI2022_Final_Project 
# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction 
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project contains various features related to breast cancer tumours, the data is taken from  digitalized image of breast tumour masses by fine needle aspiration and different models are trained to predict the diagnosis classifying it as benign and malignant.
# Project Structure  `data.csv`: Dataset containing information about breast cancer tumors.
# The dataset is first mounted on google drive and the file is read 
# Importing pandas and numpy libraries 
This code undergoes data exploration, preprocessing and model exploration.
The initial steps involve loading the dataset, exploring its structure, and performing data cleaning tasks such as removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
Data preprocessing is done and categorical variable handling and categorizing the dataset into training and testing sets. The variable attributes are arranged in the same values and other non used variables are eliminated.
We have performed data visualization and visualized the data in pir chart, scatter plot and bar graph. We have noticed trhe distribution of diagnosis of breast cancer in the pie chart. The scatter plot hgere describes the diagnosis of cancer based on the variables choosen. The bar graph is also done to notice the visualization of the cancer.
Identify and choose the variables based on their relevance to the outcome you're predicting (y value). First, we convert all data into numeric values through data encoding techniques and ensuring compatability with various machine learning models.This crucial process involves bringing all variables to a similar scale, preventing any single variable from dominating the learning process due to differences in scale. After preprocessing and normalization of data we split and train the data using k fold and access the models performance. By repeating this process with different data subsets evaluates how our model generalizes new data.
# from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
In this step, we will create, train, and test two predictive models using Decision Tree and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms. The evaluation metrics will include, at the very least, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall for every target class. We will build a decision tree to predict accuracy and complex relationship between data. We then use naive base model to find out the efficiency.
The overall correctness of the model. The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives, highlighting the model's precision for each class. recall measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances.
After analysing these models decision tree has higher accuracy
# Accuracy Comparision Decision tree has higher accuracy
